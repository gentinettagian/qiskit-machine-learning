    Calling `PegasosQSVC.decision_function()` raises an error. Fixed by writing
    own method instead of inheriting from `SVC`. The inheritance from `SVC` in
    the `PegasosQSVC` class is removed. To keep the `score` method, inheritance
    to the mixin class `ClassifierMixin` from scikit-learn is added.
